* We know the importance of music in our daily life. We humans respond and react to music and that music has a high impact on a person's brain activity. People tend to listen to music based on their mood and interests. We have the ability to communicate in different ways, non-verbal communication is one of them. It is a very powerful way of communication in which humans donâ€™t speak but they express their mood through facial expressions.
* We want to create a project which focuses on creating an application to suggest songs for user based on their mood by capturing facial expressions. 
* In this system, computer vision components are used to determine the user's emotion through facial expressions. Once the emotion is recognized, the system suggests a list of songs for that emotion, saving a lot of time for a user over selecting and playing songs manually.
